If you need to give an important message to agents, give some instructions about filling out a ticket, or add a link to your retail system, this app enables you to do it.


It also has \"data placeholder\" support, which means you can dynamically place data into the text you want to display. This is useful if you want to make a link that includes parameters about the current ticket, requester, or user.


By enabling this app, you agree to the [Built by Zendesk Terms of Use](https://www.zendesk.com/company/built-by-zendesk-agmt/)."

#### Setting up in Zendesk Support


1. Sign in to your Zendesk Support account, then click the Admin icon in the sidebar.

2. Select Apps > Marketplace, then find the Text app and click the tile.

3. On the Text app page, click Install app in the upper-right corner.

4. Enter a title to display in the \"Apps\" tray on a ticket.

5. Enter any text you want. You can use placeholders (see below) and URLs, which will auto-link.


#### About data placeholders


If you've been using Zendesk Support for some time, you might be familiar with placeholders.


These are small snippets of text which expand or transform themselves into full strings. For example, to display the current user's ID in your text, add `{{current_user.id}}` in the Text app, and it will display as the current user's ID (`2313`, for example).


Also, you could put this into a URL as a parameter:

```
// This is the text I would put in the settings:
https://www.example.com?user={{current_user.id}}


// and this is how Text app would render it:
https://www.example.com?user=2313
```

Although it's not obvious in this example, Text app will auto-link URLs for you.


#### Data placeholders you can use


Each of the data placeholders below renders a string:


* `ticket.id` current ticket ID

* `ticket.subject` current ticket subject

* `ticket.status` current ticket status

* `ticket.description` current ticket description

* `ticket.priority` current ticket priority

* `ticket.type` current ticket type

* `ticket.tags` current ticket tags, comma separated

* `ticket.requester.id` current ticket requester's ID

* `ticket.requester.name` current ticket requester's name

* `ticket.requester.email` current ticket requester's email

* `ticket.assignee.id` current ticket assignee's ID

* `ticket.assignee.name` current ticket assignee's name

* `ticket.assignee.email` current ticket assignee's email

* `current_user.id` current signed-in user's ID

* `current_user.name` current signed-in user's name

* `current_user.email` current signed-in user's email


More data placeholders will be added in the future."
